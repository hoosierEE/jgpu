While ~make~ succeeds, running the resulting executable with ~./test~ fails:
#+begin_example
dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libafcpu.3.dylib
  Referenced from: /Users/ashroyer-admin/repo/fun/jgpu/examples/hello/./test
  Reason: image not found
#+end_example

According to [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/54072747/2037637][this]], a possible fix is to update homebrew:
#+begin_src sh
brew update
brew upgrade
brew cleanup  # not sure if this step is necessary
#+end_src

The above suggestion did not solve the issue for me, but [[https://stackoverflow.com/a/17704255/2037637][this suggestion]] did, at least temporarily:
#+begin_src sh
install_name_tool -change @rpath/libafcpu.3.dylib /opt/arrayfire/lib/libafcpu.3.dylib test
#+end_src

After running the above command I the ~test~ program runs without error:
#+begin_src bash
./test
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: sum: 4979.24

* Summary
For now, getting a "hello ArrayFire" program to run on MacOS was not completely smooth, but at least answers to my questions were readily found.
Will try Linux next to compare.
