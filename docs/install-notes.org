* Ubuntu
Trying a "local" install where ArrayFire is located in ~~/Downloads~.
This may require editing makefiles.

* MacOS
These bullet points are copied from the MacOS installer from [[https://arrayfire.s3.amazonaws.com/3.7.2/ArrayFire-v3.7.2_OSX_x86_64.pkg][here]], retrieved on 2021-09-13. Keeping them here as a reference.
- Libraries will be installed in /opt/arrayfire/lib
- Headers will be installed in /opt/arrayfire/include
- Examples, documentation and CMake config files will be installed in /opt/arrayfire/share
** doxygen documentation
On MacOS, access docs like this:

#+begin_src sh
open /opt/arrayfire/share/ArrayFire/doc/html/index.htm
#+end_src

** minimal Makefile
As mentioned in the [[/opt/arrayfire/share/ArrayFire/doc/html/using_on_osx.htm][docs]], Makefiles must specify library paths explicitly:
#+begin_src makefile
LIBS=-lafcpu
LIB_PATHS=-L/opt/arrayfire/lib
INCLUDES=-I/opt/arrayfire/include
CC=g++ $(COMPILER_OPTIONS)
COMPILER_OPTIONS=-std=c++11 -g

all: main.cpp Makefile
    $(CC) main.cpp -o test $(INCLUDES) $(LIBS) $(LIB_PATHS)
#+end_src
